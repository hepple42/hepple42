## Hello everyone, I'm __Hannes__.

I'm a physicist and currently a student at the __42 Heilbronn__ coding school.
[42 Heilbronn] is a programming school with a peer learning based educational model, where I've been learning to code by working on different projects, mainly in C and C++.
The project-based approach employed by 42 Heilbronn fosteres a high level of self-organization, while the peer-to-peer learning model requires critical social skills.
After completing a 6 month internship, in addition to the core curriculum, I am looking for an opportunity to put my skills into practice.

## Some of my 42 Projects

#### [Raytracer]

My fellow 42 student [tjensen42] and I built a ray traced 3D renderer in C.
Using a path tracing algorithm, we implemented fundamental physical and mathematical concepts to generate beautiful images.
I was immediately fascinated by this direct link between physics and code.

#### [Web Server]

Together with my peers [tjensen42] and [khirsig], I created a HTTP web server in C++.
We used Nginx as a reference, and our server implements the [HTTP/1.1 standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616).
This project taught me a lot about the HTTP protocol, but also about how the Internet works in general.

#### [C++ STL Containers]

To familiarise myself with the C++ STL and template programming, I implemented the C++ containers vector, map, stack, and set from scratch. 
This includes creating a red-black tree as an underlying data structure for map and set, as well as iterator systems and utilities like std::pair or std::enable_if.

#### [Shell]

As our first major project at 42, [tjensen42] and I coded a small bash-like shell in C.
Its features include several builtins, redirections, pipes, subshells, variables, and other standard functionality.
