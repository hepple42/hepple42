## Hey everyone, I'm __Hannes__,

a quantum physicist and currently a student at __42 Heilbronn__ coding school.

[42 Heilbronn] is a programming school with a peer-learning-based eduacational model, where I've been learning to code by working on different projects, mainly in C and C++. 

I am currently working on the last project to finish the 42 core curriculum and move on to an internship.

## Some of my 42 Projects

#### [Raytracer]

My fellow 42 student [tjensen42] and I built a raytracing-based 3D renderer in C.
Using a path tracing algorithm, we were able to implement fundamental physical and mathematical concepts to generate beautiful images.
This conncetion between physics and code was especially interesting to me.

#### [Web Server]

Together with my peers [tjensen42] and [khirsig], I created a HTTP web server in C++.
We used Nginx as a reference, and our server is following the HTTP/1.1 standard.
In this project, I learned a lot about the HTTP protocol, but also about the functioning of the internet in general.

#### [C++ STL Containers]

To get familliar with the C++ STL and template programming, I recoded the C++ containers vector, map, stack, and set. 
I also implemented a red-black tree as an underlying data structure for map and set, as well as iterator systems and utilities like std::pair or std::enable_if.

#### [Shell]

As our first bigger project at 42, [tjensen42] and I coded a small bash-like shell in C.
Its features include several builtins, redirections, pipes, subshells, variables, and much more.
